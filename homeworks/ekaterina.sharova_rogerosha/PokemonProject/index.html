        <p>
            Hi! My name is Katya and I'm a Junior Frontend Developer. I am already familiar with main Web Technologies like
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git version control system.

            This page was developed during the course <a href="https://www.mastersacademy.education/frontend-for-beginners-it" class="link"> 'Frontend for beginners' from Masters Academy in 2023</a>.

            This is a social project from MOCG company where I got an opportunity to work with Frontend mentors and to create my
            own small project for the portfolio.
