            <p>Hi! My name is Vladyslav Brusentsov and I'm a Junior Frontend Developer. I am already familiar with main Web Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git version control system.
            This page was developed during the course <a href="https://www.mastersacademy.education/frontend-for-beginners-it">'Frontend for beginners' from Masters Academy in 2023.</a>
            This is a social project from MOCG company where I got an opportunity to work with Frontend mentors and to create my own small project for the portfolio.
            You can contact me via [Links to Socials Nets] and/or check out my GitHub.
